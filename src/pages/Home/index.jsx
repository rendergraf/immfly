          "Hello. This is the Immfly frontend code test. I built a web app that
          lists the first generation of Pok√©mon. I used React 18.2.0 and React
          Dom 6.8.0, for the bundle I used Webpack 5.75.0, as well as several
          libraries such as Babel, SASS, Lazy Load, and Eslint to enhance my
          code. There are other less significant libraries, but that does not
          make them any less important."
